## Installation

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change values according to your project details.
Also don't forget to `npm i`

Then just run daily:

```
node timesheet-add.js 9 12 13 18
```

If you intend to always use it like that you can simply omit those values as they are the default ones:

```
node timesheet-add.js
```
