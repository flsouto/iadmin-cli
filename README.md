## Installation

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change values according to your project details.

Also: don't forget to run `npm i`

## Usage
Just run this command daily or register it on a cronjob:

```
node timesheet-add.js 9 12 13 18
```

If you intend to always use it like that you can simply omit those values as they are the default ones:

```
node timesheet-add.js
```
